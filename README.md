# 🐠 Interactive CSS Fishbowl Animation

An experimental and fun project that simulates an interactive fishbowl using **pure CSS** and a little JavaScript. Watch the fish react as you control the water level — all within your browser!

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Pure CSS Animations** – No libraries or SVGs, just HTML and CSS.
- 🌊 **Interactive Water Flow** – Click the tap to control water filling.
- 🐟 **Fish State Logic** – The fish swims, struggles, or floats based on the water level.
- 💧 **Visual Depth** – Glass shine, floating bubbles, and smooth gradients.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** – Works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Gradients, transforms, pseudo-elements, keyframes, custom properties
- **JavaScript** – Minimal use for interactive class toggling

## 📖 How It Works

- The **tap** is clickable and toggles the class to begin water animation.
- The **water level** increases using a CSS variable (`--filling`) and transitions.
- The **fish animation** changes its movement pattern based on water height using condition-based class toggling.
- Bubbles, shine, and bowl effects are created using pseudo-elements and layers.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

This project was a great reminder that **creative constraints** (like only using CSS) often lead to the most interesting and rewarding solutions. It improved my animation and CSS logic skills and encouraged me to explore how visuals can respond to user interactions with minimal JS.
